# vdatum-mcp

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.oceanmodeling/vdatum-mcp -->

MCP server for vertical datum conversions using [coastalmodeling-vdatum](https://github.com/oceanmodeling/coastalmodeling-vdatum).

Converts elevations between NAVD88, MLLW, MLW, MHW, MHHW, LMSL, xGEOID20b, IGLD85, and LWD.

`coastalmodeling-vdatum` isn't published to PyPI, so the small amount of its
code this server actually calls is vendored directly (CC0-licensed; see
`src/vdatum_mcp/_vendor/coastalmodeling_vdatum/VENDORED.md` for the exact
commit and attribution) rather than installed as an external dependency.
