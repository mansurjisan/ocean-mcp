# STOFS MCP Server

MCP server providing AI assistants with access to NOAA's Storm Tide Operational Forecast System (STOFS) — operational storm surge and water level forecasts, and validation against CO-OPS observations.

**Status: Ready**

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `stofs_list_cycles` | List available STOFS forecast cycles on AWS S3 |
| `stofs_get_station_forecast` | Get water level forecast time series at a CO-OPS station |
| `stofs_get_point_forecast` | Get forecast at arbitrary lat/lon (nearest STOFS station) |
| `stofs_get_gridded_forecast` | Forecast at any lat/lon via OPeNDAP (regular grid, no download) |
| `stofs_compare_with_observations` | Compare STOFS forecast vs CO-OPS observations (bias, RMSE, correlation) |
| `stofs_get_max_water_level` | Get top stations by peak predicted water level in a cycle |
| `stofs_get_system_info` | STOFS model specifications, datums, cycle schedule |
| `stofs_list_stations` | List STOFS output stations, filter by state/region/proximity |

## STOFS Models

### STOFS-2D-Global (ADCIRC)
- **Domain**: Global unstructured mesh (~12.8M nodes)
- **Cycles**: 4x daily — 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC
- **Forecast**: 180 hours (7.5 days)
- **Stations**: ~385 output points at 6-minute resolution
- **Datum**: LMSL (Local Mean Sea Level)
- **Data**: [s3://noaa-gestofs-pds](https://noaa-gestofs-pds.s3.amazonaws.com)

### STOFS-3D-Atlantic (SCHISM)
- **Domain**: US East Coast + Gulf of Mexico + Puerto Rico (~2.9M nodes)
- **Cycles**: 1x daily — 12 UTC
- **Forecast**: 96 hours (4 days)
- **Stations**: ~108 output points at 6-minute resolution
- **Datum**: NAVD88
- **Data**: [s3://noaa-nos-stofs3d-pds](https://noaa-nos-stofs3d-pds.s3.amazonaws.com)

## Vertical Datums

> ⚠️ Datum differences matter when comparing models and observations:
> - **STOFS-2D station files**: LMSL (Local Mean Sea Level)
> - **STOFS-3D station files**: NAVD88
> - **CO-OPS API**: Use `datum=MSL` for 2D comparison, `datum=NAVD` for 3D comparison
> - Small systematic offsets (1–5 cm) between LMSL and MSL are expected

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mansurjisan/ocean-mcp.git
cd ocean-mcp/servers/stofs-mcp
uv sync
```

### Configure your MCP client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stofs": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/ocean-mcp/servers/stofs-mcp", "python", "-m", "stofs_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

uv run pytest tests/test_utils.py -v

# Live integration tests (requires internet, downloads ~5–10 MB)
uv run pytest tests/test_live.py -v -s
```

## Data Sources

- **AWS S3** (primary): `noaa-gestofs-pds` (2D-Global), `noaa-nos-stofs3d-pds` (3D-Atlantic)
- **NOMADS OPeNDAP**: `nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/dods/stofs_2d_glo/` (remote slice of regular-grid data, ~2-day window)
- **CO-OPS API**: `api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov` (for observation validation)
